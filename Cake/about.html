            <h3>The Cake Factory Story</h3>
            <p>
                The Cake Factory had its beginnings somewhere in 2005 when a family friend asked my sister Farah and me to do a “cookery demonstration” in their newly opened store. That little ad-hoc demonstration was followed by a sale of cakes – mainly Love Cake, which was a family favourite. The response we received was overwhelming and that gradually led us to the idea of starting our own business.

                We grew up in a large house where our grandmothers’ cooking skills were legendary. This paired with the constant flow of guests who came over for lunch, tea, or dinner meant that our lives revolved around the large family kitchen, where something was always cooking or baking. Our mother and her four sisters are all exceptional cooks, but our mother's forte was baking, and hardly a week would go by without a cake being baked at home.
